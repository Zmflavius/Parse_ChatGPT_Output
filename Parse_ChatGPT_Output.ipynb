      "What does Heidegger mean in his interview \"Only a god can save us\" when he says \"technicity\"?\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: In his 1966 <em>Der Spiegel</em> interview “Only a God Can Save Us” (<em>Nur noch ein Gott kann uns retten</em>), Martin Heidegger uses the term <strong>“Technicity”</strong> (<em>die Technik</em> or more precisely <em>die Wesensbestimmung der Technik</em>, “the essence of technology”) to refer <strong>not simply to machines or technological devices</strong>, but to a <strong>mode of revealing</strong> (<em>eine Weise des Entbergens</em>)—a fundamental way in which the modern world discloses or interprets Being.\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: Here’s a breakdown of what Heidegger means:\n",
      "Tag name: h3, Text content: 1. <strong>Technicity ≠ Technology</strong>\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: Heidegger distinguishes between:\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>Technology as tools or machines</strong> (<em>instrumental, anthropological definition</em>) — the everyday sense.\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>Technicity as a worldview</strong> — the <em>essence</em> of modern technology, which organizes and reveals the world in a specific way.\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: Technicity is <strong>not something humans control</strong>; rather, it is <strong>a historical destiny</strong> (<em>Geschick</em>) in which Being itself unfolds to humans as <em>standing-reserve</em> (<em>Bestand</em>). This means that under technicity, everything — nature, people, even thought — appears primarily as <strong>resources to be optimized, ordered, and used</strong>.\n",
      "Tag name: h3, Text content: 2. <strong>Technicity as “Enframing” (<em>Gestell</em>)</strong>\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: In his essay <em>The Question Concerning Technology</em> (1954), Heidegger calls the essence of technology <strong>Gestell</strong> — “enframing.”\n",
      "Technicity, in the interview, is a shorthand for this same idea. It names <strong>the totalizing frame</strong> within which the modern world discloses beings: as objects to be calculated, controlled, and stored for use.\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: In the interview he says:\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: QuoteStart“The essence of technology is nothing technological.”\n",
      "Meaning: technicity is a <strong>metaphysical condition</strong>, not a collection of gadgets. It’s a way of thinking — or a destiny of Being — that predefines what counts as “real.”\n",
      "Tag name: h3, Text content: 3. <strong>The Danger of Technicity</strong>\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: For Heidegger, the danger is that technicity <strong>obscures other ways of revealing truth</strong>.\n",
      "If everything appears only as a resource — as energy to be extracted or data to be processed — then <strong>poetic, sacred, or meditative modes of Being</strong> are forgotten.\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: He says modern humanity is “<em>claimed by</em>” technicity rather than in command of it. This loss of alternative ways of understanding Being leads to <strong>a spiritual impoverishment</strong>, even as technical power increases.\n",
      "Tag name: h3, Text content: 4. <strong>Why “Only a God Can Save Us”</strong>\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: In the interview, Heidegger says:\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: QuoteStart“Philosophy will not be able to bring about a direct change in the present state of the world. Only a god can still save us.”\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: By this, he means that <strong>only a radically different “disclosure of Being”</strong> — comparable in depth to a religious or poetic revelation — can free us from the grip of technicity. Not a literal deity, but a new, non-technological way in which Being might show itself.\n",
      "Tag name: h3, Text content: <strong>In short:</strong>\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>Technicity</strong> in Heidegger’s interview refers to:\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: QuoteStartThe metaphysical condition in which all beings appear as objects of control and use — the modern mode of revealing that enframes the world as “standing-reserve.”\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: It’s both <strong>a destiny of Western metaphysics</strong> and <strong>the horizon within which modern life unfolds</strong>.\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: Would you like me to include a few key passages from the interview itself (in German and English) where he uses <em>Technik</em> or refers to this concept explicitly?\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: Excellent — here are the <strong>key excerpts</strong> from Martin Heidegger’s 1966 <em>Der Spiegel</em> interview, <em>“Nur noch ein Gott kann uns retten”</em> (“Only a God Can Save Us”), with the relevant parts on <strong>technicity (die Technik)</strong> and brief commentary for each.\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: I’ll give each in <strong>German</strong>, <strong>English translation</strong>, and <strong>commentary</strong>.\n",
      "Tag name: h2, Text content: 🧩 1. The Historical Destiny of Technicity\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>German (original):</strong>\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: QuoteStart„Die Wissenschaft denkt nicht. … Sie ist auf die Herstellung des Forschens als solchen in der Weise der technischen Organisation angewiesen. Diese Organisation aber ist heute weltweit. … Die Technik ist nicht etwas Menschliches, sondern sie ist ein Geschick des Seins selbst.“\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>English translation:</strong>\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: QuoteStart“Science does not think. … It depends on the production of research as such in the manner of technical organization. This organization, however, is now worldwide. … Technology is not something human, but rather a destiny of Being itself.”\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>Commentary:</strong>\n",
      "Heidegger draws a sharp line between <strong>science as thinking</strong> and <strong>science as technical production</strong>. The latter—modern research—is structured by <strong>technicity</strong>: an organizational, global process that determines how knowledge and being appear.\n",
      "This is why he says technology (<em>die Technik</em>) is not just a human creation; it is a <strong>“Geschick des Seins,”</strong> a fate or sending of Being itself. Humanity finds itself already within this destiny.\n",
      "Tag name: h2, Text content: ⚙️ 2. The Uncontrollability of Technicity\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>German:</strong>\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: QuoteStart„Wir stehen in der Technik, und zwar so, daß die Technik uns in ihrem Wesen beansprucht. … Der Mensch steht heute in der Technik nicht mehr als deren Herr, sondern als der, der von ihr beansprucht wird.“\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>English:</strong>\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: QuoteStart“We stand within technology, and in such a way that technology claims us in its essence. … Man today no longer stands as the master of technology, but as the one who is claimed by it.”\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>Commentary:</strong>\n",
      "This is central to his notion of <strong>Gestell</strong> (enframing): technicity is a <em>power that claims humans</em>, not something they merely operate. Even efforts to “control” technology (ethically, politically) already presuppose the same technical mindset. Thus, technicity defines <strong>our very relation to the world</strong>, not just our tools.\n",
      "Tag name: h2, Text content: 🌍 3. Technicity as the Global Condition\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>German:</strong>\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: QuoteStart„Die planetarische Bewegung der Technik ist ein einheitliches Geschehen, in das alle Kulturen eingetreten sind, oder eintreten müssen.“\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>English:</strong>\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: QuoteStart“The planetary movement of technology is a unified event into which all cultures have entered—or must enter.”\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>Commentary:</strong>\n",
      "Here he anticipates what we would now call <strong>globalization</strong> or <strong>technological modernity</strong>. Technicity is not a Western invention that can be exported or rejected; it is a <strong>planetary event</strong>, an ontological horizon that reorganizes every culture’s relation to Being. In this sense, it’s not avoidable—only transformable through a new “revelation.”\n",
      "Tag name: h2, Text content: 🕯️ 4. The Danger and the Saving Power\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>German:</strong>\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: QuoteStart„Das Wesen der Technik birgt in sich das Rettende. … Vielleicht können wir, wenn wir das Wesen der Technik bedenken, uns vorbereiten auf die Ankunft des Gottes oder auf die Abwesenheit des Gottes im Untergang.“\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>English:</strong>\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: QuoteStart“The essence of technology harbors within itself the saving power. … Perhaps when we ponder the essence of technology, we can prepare ourselves for the coming of the god—or for the absence of the god in the downfall.”\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>Commentary:</strong>\n",
      "This echoes the line from his essay <em>The Question Concerning Technology</em>:\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: QuoteStart“Where danger is, grows the saving power.” (<em>Wo aber Gefahr ist, wächst das Rettende auch.</em>)\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: For Heidegger, thinking deeply about technicity itself—recognizing it as a destiny rather than merely a collection of machines—could open humanity to a <strong>new relation to Being</strong>, possibly a divine or poetic disclosure that “saves” us.\n",
      "Tag name: h2, Text content: 🪞 5. Why “Only a God Can Save Us”\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>German:</strong>\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: QuoteStart„Nur noch ein Gott kann uns retten. … Das Denken kann uns nicht unmittelbar zur Umkehr bringen. … Wir können uns nur vorbereiten, indem wir das Denken vorbereiten, das aus der Erfahrung der Wahrheit des Seins hervorgeht.“\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>English:</strong>\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: QuoteStart“Only a god can still save us. … Thinking cannot bring about a direct reversal. … We can only prepare ourselves by awakening the thinking that arises from the experience of the truth of Being.”\n",
      "Tag name: p, Text content: <strong>Commentary:</strong>\n",
      "Heidegger does <strong>not</strong> mean a return to theology. The “god” here is a <strong>symbol for a new dispensation of Being</strong>—a radically different way in which truth might manifest. The path lies in <strong>thinking the essence of technicity</strong> without immediately seeking to dominate or escape it.\n",
