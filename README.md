Parse ChatGPT html downloads and render a word doc that preserves most ChatGPT formatting.

Deep thanks to @jcubic's ChatGPT download bookmarktool that I leveraged to cleanly download the chats (read about it here: https://jcubic.github.io/chat-gpt/#about).

This tool requires Jupyter to be installed, and has pandas and beautifulsoup4 as dependences. In addition, you will need to download the HTMLs of your ChatGPT conversation using the bookmarktool.
